///tour de force of visualizations and mario party mini game mode - add game content using games 


//use AI to generate basics around persons house 


//more advanced quests = people co-designing
// other people auditing 
//satisifes need to create stories in like creative writing class - find out who dunnit - sherlock holmes nerighborhood 

https://www.thewordfinder.com/wordlibs/

right now - have people type it and then parse that into a game data model using Natural language processing 

//make a gant chart for 2 years of development - auto-make



//data created from users interacting with world = powers next generation AI to automate reality and make self-government easy and fun




//quest list

// go get sand from beach and then make a castle 
//use ai to create dreams


//make  game so user feels comfortable and familiar 
//then use ai-dream making inception tech to make them wizards



//make an MVP in 3 hours - use AI to generate quests that link to your current one 
//or use a human who just makes up shit and you do it

//prototype would be: streamers make quests and the only user or two does them to show data generated - 


//user walked 300 steps at a 30 degree angle 
//user completed quest in 30 minutes

//https://beta.aidungeon.com/adventure/LUwKZ5djpts9/wizard/play



//use algorithm to generate story as person walks around town. never a dull moment. you step out house and dumbledore uses lighter to darken the village. 

//then he talks to you. 

//you cna ignore him or take his quest 


//you need quest givers and quest givees

//get 500 gold for creating quest, and 500 gold for completing 

//use gold to buy spells 





//create comunities and explore cities together 
//assume infinite user base 
//explore together for 1 hour a day

//stream has to be 100% positive

//this game is a portal into mr.beast like quests to make a better world 

//make a garden


//how many nerighborhoods in the world

//2030 - poverty erradicated 


//make a database of every neighborhood in the world - see quests in neighborhood 


//targeting reticule - HUD
//metroid prime - scan visor , 

//go into forest and gather acorns - find every foreset in world and find collectibles


//neighborhood has an item
// neighborhood table


//items table


//1000 items types


//wizard school in each city
//apothetcary in each neighborhood, wand maker, spell scroll dealer


//organize world into quests, raids and so one

//little kids want to play with stream in a highlhy structured and sand-boxed way

//9. trade acorns with other neighborhood 
//10. summon sand spirit to gather more sand (in middle of night the sand people come and deposit sand - tooth fairy)
//11. make infinte castle (super mario maker)


//make games that werent possible before stream
//stream can do teamspeak
//stream can do HUDS (someday)
//stream can do visions - earn from computer 


//reserach digitization of qualia so that computers can track kid's focus and do stuff 


//types of quests - science experiments, community building, fetch, make food, make art

//build shrine - gather reagents to add magic to neighborhood
//casting a spell uses mana from the neighborhood shrine
//gain favor from shrine which unlocks higher tiers of spells 

//magic comes from nature

//sancrutary

//kids can make money by gathering reagents and crafting rare items

//transition world to eutopia
//need trust in stream
//stream inventors need lots of data to train AI on to automate government and world and community building - grass roots government network state
//smaller countries = easier to govern

//take over territory with wizard factions

//exhange reagents for percentage ownership of wizard factions

//give business to local businesses 


//get PHD in neuroscience
